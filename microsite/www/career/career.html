	In 1986, Dr. Dre met rapper O'Shea Jackson—nicknamed Ice Cube—who collaborated with Dr. Dre to
record songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper Eazy-E. N.W.A and fellow West
Coast rapper Ice-T are widely credited as seminal artists of the gangsta rap genre, a profanity-heavy
subgenre of hip hop, replete with gritty depictions of urban crime and gang lifestyle. Not feeling
constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie
Down Productions, N.W.A favored themes and uncompromising lyrics, offering stark descriptions of
violent, inner-city streets. Propelled by the hit "Fuck tha Police", the group's first full album Straight Outta
Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert
tours. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent Ruthless Records a warning letter in response to the
song's content.

After Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of
the group's second album Efil4zaggin. He also produced tracks for a number of other acts on Ruthless
Records, including Eazy-E's 1988 solo debut Eazy-Duz-It, Above the Law's 1990 debut Livin' Like
Hustlers, Michel'le's 1989 self title'd debut, The D.O.C.'s 1989 debut No One Can Do It Better, J.J. Fad's
1988 debut Supersonic and funk rock musician Jimmy Z's 1991 album Muzical Madness.

After a dispute with Eazy-E, Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of
friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious
strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr. Dre
as his flagship artist, founded Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track
to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he met through Warren G.
Dr. Dre's debut solo album was The Chronic, released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as
executive producer.

Dr. Dre's second solo album, 2001, released on November 16, 1999, was considered an
ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots.
It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a
sequel to his debut solo effort The Chronic but was re-titled 2001 after Death Row Records released
an unrelated compilation album with the title Chronic 2000: Still Smokin in May 1999. Other tentative
titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre. The album featured numerous collaborators,
including Devin the Dude, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Eminem, Knoc-turn'al, King
T, Defari, Kokane, Mary J. Blige and new protégé Hittman, as well as co-production between Dre
and new Aftermath producer Mel-Man. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website AllMusic described
the sound of the album as "adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae" to Dr. Dre's
style.
 The album was highly successful, charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts and
has since been certified six times platinum, validating a recurring theme on the album: Dr. Dre was
still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. The
album included popular hit singles "Still D.R.E." and "Forgot About Dre", both of which Dr. Dre
performed on NBC's Saturday Night Live on October 23, 1999. Dr. Dre won the Grammy
Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical in 2000, and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with
fellow rappers Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube that year as well.
