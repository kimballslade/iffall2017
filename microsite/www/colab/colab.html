Following the success of 2001, Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists. He
co-produced six tracks on Eminem's landmark Marshall Mathers LP, including the Grammy-winning
lead single, "The Real Slim Shady". The album itself earned a Grammy and proved to be the fastestselling
rap album of all time, moving 1.76 million units in its first week alone. He produced the
single "Family Affair" by R&B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001. He also
produced "Let Me Blow Ya Mind", a duet by rapper Eve and No Doubt lead singer Gwen
Stefani and signed R&B singer Truth Hurts to Aftermath in 2001. Dr. Dre was the executive
producer of Eminem's 2002 release, The Eminem Show. He produced three songs on the album,
one of which was released as a single, and he appeared in the award-winning video for "Without
Me". He also produced The D.O.C.'s 2003 album Deuce, where he made a guest appearance on the
tracks "Psychic Pymp Hotline", "Gorilla Pympin'" and "Judgment Day".

On his Beats 1 radio show "The Pharmacy" on August 1, 2015, Dre announced that he would
release what would be his final album, titled Compton. It is inspired by the N.W.A biopic Straight
Outta Compton and is a compilation-style album, featuring a number of frequent collaborators,
including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Xzibit and The Game, among others. It was
released exclusively for iTunes and Apple Music on August 7. A physical version was published on
August 21. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he revealed that he had about 20 to 40 tracks
for Detox but he didn't release it because it didn't meet his standards and he thought he was done
being an artist. He also revealed that he suffers from social anxiety and due to this he remains
secluded and out of attention.
