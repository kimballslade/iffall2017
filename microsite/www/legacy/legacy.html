	In 2001, Dr. Dre earned a total of about US$52 million from selling part of his share of Aftermath
Entertainment to Interscope Records and his production of such hit songs that year as "Family Affair"
by Mary J. Blige. Rolling Stone magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the
year. Dr. Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of $11.4 million, primarily from production
royalties from such projects as albums from G-Unit and D12 and the single "Rich Girl" by
singer Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve. Forbes estimated his net worth at US$270 million in
2012.
The same publication later reported that he acquired US$110 million via his various
endeavors in 2012, making him the highestâ€“paid artist of the year.
