				You must think that I'm a fool<br />
				You must think that I'm new to this<br />
				But I have seen this all before<br />

				I'm never gonna let you close to me<br />
				Even though you mean the most to me<br />
				'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br />
				So I'm never gonna get too close to you<br />
				Even when I mean the most to you<br />
				In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br />
			</p>

			<div class="chorus">
				Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br />
				And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br />
				And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br />
				Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true<br />

				I know you're thinking I'm cold<br />
				I'm just protecting my innocence<br />
				I'm just protecting my soul<br />
