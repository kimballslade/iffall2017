<h1>Too Good At Goodbyes</h1>
<h2>Sam Smith</h2>

<p>
You must think that I'm stupid<br />
You must think that I'm a fool<br />
You must think that I'm new to this<br />
But I have seen this all before<br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
I'm never gonna let you close to me<br />
Even though you mean the most to me<br />
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br />
So I'm never gonna get too close to you<br />
Even when I mean the most to you<br />
In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br />
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br />
And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br />
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true<br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way too good at goodbyes)</em><br />
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way too good at goodbyes)</em><br />
No way that you'll see me cry<br />
<em id="backup">(No way that you'll see me cry)</em><br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
I know you're thinking I'm heartless<br />
I know you're thinking I'm cold<br />
I'm just protecting my innocence<br />
I'm just protecting my soul<br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
I'm never gonna let you close to me<br />
Even though you mean the most to me<br />
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br />
So I'm never gonna get too close to you<br />
Even when I mean the most to you<br />
In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br />
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br />
And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br />
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true<br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
I'm way to good at goodbyes<br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way to good at goodbyes)</em><br />
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way too good at goodbyes)</em><br />
No way that you'll see me cry<br />
<em id="backup">(No way that you'll see me cry)</em><br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
No way that you'll see me cry<br />
<em id="backup">(No way that you'll see me cry)</em><br />
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way to good at goodbyes)</em><br />
No<br />
No, no, no, no, no<br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way too good at goodbyes)</em><br />
No, no, no, no<br />
No, no, no<br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way too good at goodbyes)</em><br />
<em id="backup">(No way that you'll see me cry)</em><br />
<em id="backup">(I'm way too good at goodbyes)</em><br />
</p>

<br />

<p>
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br />
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br />
And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br />
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true<br />
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br />
