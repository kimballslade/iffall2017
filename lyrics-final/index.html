				I'm never gonna let you close to me<br />
				Even though you mean the most to me<br />
				'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br />
				So I'm never gonna get too close to you<br />
				Even when I mean the most to you<br />
				In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br />

				I know you're thinking I'm heartless<br />

				So I'm never gonna get too close to you<br />
